"Iterating over a message object tree is fairly easy with the "
":meth:`Message.walk <email.message.Message.walk>` method.  The "
":mod:`email.iterators` module provides some useful higher level iterations "
"over message object trees."

"This iterates over all the payloads in all the subparts of *msg*, returning "
"the string payloads line-by-line.  It skips over all the subpart headers, "
"and it skips over any subpart with a payload that isn't a Python string.  "
"This is somewhat equivalent to reading the flat text representation of the "
"message from a file using :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline`, skipping over all"
" the intervening headers."

"Optional *decode* is passed through to :meth:`Message.get_payload "
"<email.message.Message.get_payload>`."

"This iterates over all the subparts of *msg*, returning only those subparts "
"that match the MIME type specified by *maintype* and *subtype*."

"Note that *subtype* is optional; if omitted, then subpart MIME type matching"
" is done only with the main type.  *maintype* is optional too; it defaults "
"to :mimetype:`text`."

"Thus, by default :func:`typed_subpart_iterator` returns each subpart that "
"has a MIME type of :mimetype:`text/\\*`."

"The following function has been added as a useful debugging tool.  It should"

"Optional *fp* is a file-like object to print the output to.  It must be "
"suitable for Python's :func:`print` function.  *level* is used internally. "
"*include_default*, if true, prints the default type as well."
