"The :mod:`pprint` module provides a capability to \"pretty-print\" arbitrary"
" Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the "
"interpreter. If the formatted structures include objects which are not "
"fundamental Python types, the representation may not be loadable.  This may "
"be the case if objects such as files, sockets or classes are included, as "
"well as many other objects which are not representable as Python literals."

"The formatted representation keeps objects on a single line if it can, and "
"breaks them onto multiple lines if they don't fit within the allowed width. "

"the width constraint."

"Construct a :class:`PrettyPrinter` instance.  This constructor understands "
"several keyword parameters.  An output stream may be set using the *stream* "
"keyword; the only method used on the stream object is the file protocol's "
":meth:`write` method.  If not specified, the :class:`PrettyPrinter` adopts "
"``sys.stdout``.  The amount of indentation added for each recursive level is"
" specified by *indent*; the default is one.  Other values can cause output "
"to look a little odd, but can make nesting easier to spot.  The number of "
"levels which may be printed is controlled by *depth*; if the data structure "
"being printed is too deep, the next contained level is replaced by ``...``."
"  By default, there is no constraint on the depth of the objects being "
"formatted.  The desired output width is constrained using the *width* "
"parameter; the default is 80 characters.  If a structure cannot be formatted"
" within the constrained width, a best effort will be made.  If *compact* is "
"false (the default) each item of a long sequence will be formatted on a "
"separate line.  If *compact* is true, as many items as will fit within the "
"*width* will be formatted on each output line."

"return value should be ``True``.  Recursive calls to the :meth:`format` "
