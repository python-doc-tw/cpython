"The SAX API defines four kinds of handlers: content handlers, DTD handlers, "
"error handlers, and entity resolvers. Applications normally only need to "
"implement those interfaces whose events they are interested in; they can "

"implementations should inherit from the base classes provided in the module "
":mod:`xml.sax.handler`, so that all methods get default implementations."
