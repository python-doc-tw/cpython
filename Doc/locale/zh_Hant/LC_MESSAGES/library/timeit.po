"This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code. It has "
"both a :ref:`command-line-interface` as well as a :ref:`callable <python-"
"interface>` one.  It avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution"
" times. See also Tim Peters' introduction to the \"Algorithms\" chapter in "
"the *Python Cookbook*, published by O'Reilly."

"The constructor takes a statement to be timed, an additional statement used "

"and *setup* may also contain multiple statements separated by ``;`` or "
"newlines, as long as they don't contain multi-line string literals.  The "
"statement will by default be executed within timeit's namespace; this "

"It's tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation from the result "

" the given code snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically "
"not caused by variability in Python's speed, but by other processes "
"interfering with your timing accuracy. So the :func:`min` of the result is "
