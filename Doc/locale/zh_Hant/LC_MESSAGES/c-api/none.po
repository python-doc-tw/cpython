"Note that the :c:type:`PyTypeObject` for ``None`` is not directly exposed in"
" the Python/C API.  Since ``None`` is a singleton, testing for object "
"identity (using ``==`` in C) is sufficient. There is no "
":c:func:`PyNone_Check` function for the same reason."

"The Python ``None`` object, denoting lack of value.  This object has no "
"methods. It needs to be treated just like any other object with respect to "
"reference counts."

"is, increment the reference count of None and return it.)"
