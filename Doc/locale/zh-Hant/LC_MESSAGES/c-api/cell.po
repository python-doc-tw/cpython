"scopes. For each such variable, a cell object is created to store the value;"

"a reference to the cells from outer scopes which also use that variable.  "
"When the value is accessed, the value contained in the cell is used instead "
"of the cell object itself.  This de-referencing of the cell object requires "
"support from the generated byte-code; these are not automatically de-"
