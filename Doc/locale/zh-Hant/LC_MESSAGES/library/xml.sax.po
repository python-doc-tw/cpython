msgid ""
"The :mod:`xml.sax` package provides a number of modules which implement the "
"Simple API for XML (SAX) interface for Python.  The package itself provides "
"the SAX exceptions and the convenience functions which will be most used by "
"users of the SAX API."

msgid ""
"Create and return a SAX :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader` object.  The "
"first parser found will be used.  If *parser_list* is provided, it must be a"
" sequence of strings which name modules that have a function named "
":func:`create_parser`.  Modules listed in *parser_list* will be used before "
"modules in the default list of parsers."

"Create a SAX parser and use it to parse a document.  The document, passed in"
" as *filename_or_stream*, can be a filename or a file object.  The *handler*"
" parameter needs to be a SAX :class:`~handler.ContentHandler` instance.  If "
"*error_handler* is given, it must be a SAX :class:`~handler.ErrorHandler` "
"instance; if omitted,  :exc:`SAXParseException` will be raised on all "
"errors.  There is no return value; all work must be done by the *handler* "

"A typical SAX application uses three kinds of objects: readers, handlers and"
" input sources.  \"Reader\" in this context is another term for parser, i.e."
" some piece of code that reads the bytes or characters from the input "
"source, and produces a sequence of events. The events then get distributed "
"to the handler objects, i.e. the reader invokes a method on the handler.  A "
"SAX application must therefore obtain a reader object, create or open the "
"input sources, create the handlers, and connect these objects all together."
"  As the final step of preparation, the reader is called to parse the input."
" During parsing, methods on the handler objects are called based on "
"structural and syntactic events from the input data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/xml.sax.rst:67
msgid ""
"For these objects, only the interfaces are relevant; they are normally not "
"instantiated by the application itself.  Since Python does not have an "
"explicit notion of interface, they are formally introduced as classes, but "
"applications may use implementations which do not inherit from the provided "
"classes.  The :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource`, "
":class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.Locator`, :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.Attributes`,"
" :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.AttributesNS`, and "
":class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader` interfaces are defined in the module "
":mod:`xml.sax.xmlreader`.  The handler interfaces are defined in "
":mod:`xml.sax.handler`.  For convenience, "
":class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` (which is often instantiated "
"directly) and the handler classes are also available from :mod:`xml.sax`.  "
"These interfaces are described below."

"In addition to these classes, :mod:`xml.sax` provides the following "
"exception classes."

msgid ""
"Encapsulate an XML error or warning.  This class can contain basic error or "
"warning information from either the XML parser or the application: it can be"
" subclassed to provide additional functionality or to add localization.  "
"Note that although the handlers defined in the "
":class:`~xml.sax.handler.ErrorHandler` interface receive instances of this "
"exception, it is not required to actually raise the exception --- it is also"
" useful as a container for information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/xml.sax.rst:94
msgid ""
"When instantiated, *msg* should be a human-readable description of the "
"error. The optional *exception* parameter, if given, should be ``None`` or "
