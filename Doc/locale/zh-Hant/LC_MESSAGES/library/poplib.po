"This module defines a class, :class:`POP3`, which encapsulates a connection "
"to a POP3 server and implements the protocol as defined in :rfc:`1939`. The "
":class:`POP3` class supports both the minimal and optional command sets from"
" :rfc:`1939`. The :class:`POP3` class also supports the ``STLS`` command "
"introduced in :rfc:`2595` to enable encrypted communication on an already "
"established connection."

"Note that POP3, though widely supported, is obsolescent.  The implementation"
" quality of POP3 servers varies widely, and too many are quite poor. If your"
" mailserver supports IMAP, you would be better off using the "
":class:`imaplib.IMAP4` class, as IMAP servers tend to be better implemented."

"timeout setting will be used)."

"*context* is an optional :class:`ssl.SSLContext` object which allows "
