"This document aims to provide a gentle introduction to the :mod:`ipaddress` "

"For readers that aren't particularly familiar with IP addressing, it's "
"important to know that the Internet Protocol is currently in the process of "
"moving from version 4 of the protocol to version 6. This transition is "
"occurring largely because version 4 of the protocol doesn't provide enough "
"addresses to handle the needs of the whole world, especially given the "
"increasing number of devices with direct connections to the internet."

"Explaining the details of the differences between the two versions of the "
"protocol is beyond the scope of this introduction, but readers need to at "
"least be aware that these two versions exist, and it will sometimes be "
"necessary to force the use of one version or the other."

"Addresses, often referred to as \"host addresses\" are the most basic unit "
"when working with IP addressing. The simplest way to create addresses is to "
"use the :func:`ipaddress.ip_address` factory function, which automatically "
"determines whether to create an IPv4 or IPv6 address based on the passed in "
"value:"

"Addresses can also be created directly from integers. Values that will fit "
"within 32 bits are assumed to be IPv4 addresses::"

"To force the use of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, the relevant classes can be "

msgid "Defining Networks"

#: ../../howto/ipaddress.rst:85
msgid ""
"Host addresses are usually grouped together into IP networks, so "
":mod:`ipaddress` provides a way to create, inspect and manipulate network "
"definitions. IP network objects are constructed from strings that define the"
" range of host addresses that are part of that network. The simplest form "
"for that information is a \"network address/network prefix\" pair, where the"
" prefix defines the number of leading bits that are compared to determine "
"whether or not an address is part of the network and the network address "
"defines the expected value of those bits."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/ipaddress.rst:94
msgid ""
"As for addresses, a factory function is provided that determines the correct"
" IP version automatically::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/ipaddress.rst:102
msgid ""
"Network objects cannot have any host bits set.  The practical effect of this"
" is that ``192.0.2.1/24`` does not describe a network.  Such definitions are"
" referred to as interface objects since the ip-on-a-network notation is "
"commonly used to describe network interfaces of a computer on a given "
"network and are described further in the next section."
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/ipaddress.rst:108
msgid ""
"By default, attempting to create a network object with host bits set will "
"result in :exc:`ValueError` being raised. To request that the additional "
"bits instead be coerced to zero, the flag ``strict=False`` can be passed to "
"the constructor::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../howto/ipaddress.rst:120
msgid ""
"While the string form offers significantly more flexibility, networks can "
"also be defined with integers, just like host addresses. In this case, the "
"network is considered to contain only the single address identified by the "
"integer, so the network prefix includes the entire network address::"
msgstr ""

"As with addresses, creation of a particular kind of network can be forced by"
" calling the class constructor directly instead of using the factory "
"function."

"As mentioned just above, if you need to describe an address on a particular "
"network, neither the address nor the network classes are sufficient. "
"Notation like ``192.0.2.1/24`` is commonly used by network engineers and the"
" people who write tools for firewalls and routers as shorthand for \"the "
"host ``192.0.2.1`` on the network ``192.0.2.0/24``\", Accordingly, "
":mod:`ipaddress` provides a set of hybrid classes that associate an address "
"with a particular network. The interface for creation is identical to that "
"for defining network objects, except that the address portion isn't "
"constrained to being a network address."

"To support use cases where it is useful to have access to this additional "
