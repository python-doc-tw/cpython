msgid "The Python interpreter is usually installed as :file:`/usr/local/bin/python3.5` on those machines where it is available; putting :file:`/usr/local/bin` in your Unix shell's search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:"

msgid "to the shell. [#]_ Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator.  (E.g., :file:`/usr/local/python` is a popular alternative location.)"

msgid "On Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in :file:`C:\\\\Python35`, though you can change this when you're running the installer.  To add this directory to your path,  you can type the following command into the command prompt in a DOS box::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:33
msgid "Typing an end-of-file character (:kbd:`Control-D` on Unix, :kbd:`Control-Z` on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status.  If that doesn't work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: ``quit()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:38
msgid "The interpreter's line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support readline.  Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing :kbd:`Control-P` to the first Python prompt you get.  If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix :ref:`tut-interacting` for an introduction to the keys.  If nothing appears to happen, or if ``^P`` is echoed, command line editing isn't available; you'll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line."

msgid "The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a *script* from that file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:52
msgid "A second way of starting the interpreter is ``python -c command [arg] ...``, which executes the statement(s) in *command*, analogous to the shell's :option:`-c` option.  Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote *command* in its entirety with single quotes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:58
msgid "Some Python modules are also useful as scripts.  These can be invoked using ``python -m module [arg] ...``, which executes the source file for *module* as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:62
msgid "When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards.  This can be done by passing :option:`-i` before the script."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:74
msgid "When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the ``argv`` variable in the ``sys`` module.  You can access this list by executing ``import sys``.  The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, ``sys.argv[0]`` is an empty string.  When the script name is given as ``'-'`` (meaning  standard input), ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to ``'-'``.  When :option:`-c` *command* is used, ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to ``'-c'``.  When :option:`-m` *module* is used, ``sys.argv[0]``  is set to the full name of the located module.  Options found after  :option:`-c` *command* or :option:`-m` *module* are not consumed  by the Python interpreter's option processing but left in ``sys.argv`` for  the command or module to handle."

msgid "Interactive Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:92
msgid "When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in *interactive mode*.  In this mode it prompts for the next command with the *primary prompt*, usually three greater-than signs (``>>>``); for continuation lines it prompts with the *secondary prompt*, by default three dots (``...``). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt::"

msgid "Source Code Encoding"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:131
msgid "By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.  In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments --- although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow.  To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:139
msgid "It is also possible to specify a different encoding for source files.  In order to do this, put one more special comment line right after the ``#!`` line to define the source file encoding::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:145
msgid "With that declaration, everything in the source file will be treated as having the encoding *encoding* instead of UTF-8.  The list of possible encodings can be found in the Python Library Reference, in the section on :mod:`codecs`."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, if your editor of choice does not support UTF-8 encoded files and insists on using some other encoding, say Windows-1252, you can write::"
