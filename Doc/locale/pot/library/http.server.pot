#: ../../library/http.server.rst:32
msgid "This class builds on the :class:`~socketserver.TCPServer` class by storing the server address as instance variables named :attr:`server_name` and :attr:`server_port`. The server is accessible by the handler, typically through the handler's :attr:`server` instance variable."

msgid "This class is used to handle the HTTP requests that arrive at the server.  By itself, it cannot respond to any actual HTTP requests; it must be subclassed to handle each request method (e.g. GET or POST). :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` provides a number of class and instance variables, and methods for use by subclasses."

For example, for the request method ``SPAM``, the :meth:`do_SPAM` method will be called with no arguments. All of the relevant information is stored in instance variables of the handler.  Subclasses should not need to override or extend the :meth:`__init__` method."
