msgid "The :mod:`codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-print loop can be emulated, as is done in the :mod:`code` module.  As a result, you probably don't want to use the module directly; if you want to include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the :mod:`code` module instead."

msgid "There are two parts to this job:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:17
msgid "Being able to tell if a line of input completes a Python  statement: in short, telling whether to print '``>>>``' or '``...``' next."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:20
msgid "Remembering which future statements the user has entered, so  subsequent input can be compiled with these in effect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:23
msgid "The :mod:`codeop` module provides a way of doing each of these things, and a way of doing them both."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:26
msgid "To do just the former:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:30
msgid "Tries to compile *source*, which should be a string of Python code and return a code object if *source* is valid Python code. In that case, the filename attribute of the code object will be *filename*, which defaults to ``'<input>'``. Returns ``None`` if *source* is *not* valid Python code, but is a prefix of valid Python code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:36
msgid "If there is a problem with *source*, an exception will be raised. :exc:`SyntaxError` is raised if there is invalid Python syntax, and :exc:`OverflowError` or :exc:`ValueError` if there is an invalid literal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:40
msgid "The *symbol* argument determines whether *source* is compiled as a statement (``'single'``, the default) or as an :term:`expression` (``'eval'``).  Any other value will cause :exc:`ValueError` to  be raised."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:46
msgid "It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case, trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.  For example, a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by arbitrary garbage. This will be fixed once the API for the parser is better."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:55
msgid "Instances of this class have :meth:`__call__` methods identical in signature to the built-in function :func:`compile`, but with the difference that if the instance compiles program text containing a :mod:`__future__` statement, the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts with the statement in force."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/codeop.rst:64
msgid "Instances of this class have :meth:`__call__` methods identical in signature to :func:`compile_command`; the difference is that if the instance compiles program text containing a ``__future__`` statement, the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts with the statement in force."
