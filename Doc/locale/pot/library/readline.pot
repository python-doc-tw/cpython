msgid "The :mod:`readline` module defines a number of functions to facilitate completion and reading/writing of history files from the Python interpreter. This module can be used directly or via the :mod:`rlcompleter` module.  Settings made using  this module affect the behaviour of both the interpreter's interactive prompt  and the prompts offered by the built-in :func:`input` function."

msgid "On MacOS X the :mod:`readline` module can be implemented using the ``libedit`` library instead of GNU readline."

#: ../../library/readline.rst:22
msgid "The configuration file for ``libedit`` is different from that of GNU readline. If you programmatically load configuration strings you can check for the text \"libedit\" in :const:`readline.__doc__` to differentiate between GNU readline and libedit."
