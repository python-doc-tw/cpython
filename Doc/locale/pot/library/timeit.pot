msgid "This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code. It has both a :ref:`command-line-interface` as well as a :ref:`callable <python-interface>` one.  It avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution times. See also Tim Peters' introduction to the \"Algorithms\" chapter in the *Python Cookbook*, published by O'Reilly."

msgid "The constructor takes a statement to be timed, an additional statement used for setup, and a timer function.  Both statements default to ``'pass'``; the timer function is platform-dependent (see the module doc string). *stmt* and *setup* may also contain multiple statements separated by ``;`` or newlines, as long as they don't contain multi-line string literals.  The statement will by default be executed within timeit's namespace; this behavior can be controlled by passing a namespace to *globals*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/timeit.rst:103

msgid "Time *number* executions of the main statement.  This executes the setup statement once, and then returns the time it takes to execute the main statement a number of times, measured in seconds as a float. The argument is the number of times through the loop, defaulting to one million.  The main statement, the setup statement and the timer function to be used are passed to the constructor."

#: ../../library/timeit.rst:128
msgid "By default, :meth:`.timeit` temporarily turns off :term:`garbage collection` during the timing.  The advantage of this approach is that it makes independent timings more comparable.  This disadvantage is that GC may be an important component of the performance of the function being measured.  If so, GC can be re-enabled as the first statement in the *setup* string.  For example::"

msgstr ""

#: ../../library/timeit.rst:149
msgid "It's tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation from the result vector and report these.  However, this is not very useful. In a typical case, the lowest value gives a lower bound for how fast your machine can run the given code snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically not caused by variability in Python's speed, but by other processes interfering with your timing accuracy. So the :func:`min` of the result is probably the only number you should be interested in.  After that, you should look at the entire vector and apply common sense rather than statistics."
