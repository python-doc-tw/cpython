msgid ":mod:`termios` --- POSIX style tty control"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:13
msgid "This module provides an interface to the POSIX calls for tty I/O control.  For a complete description of these calls, see the POSIX or Unix manual pages.  It is only available for those Unix versions that support POSIX *termios* style tty I/O control (and then only if configured at installation time)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:18
msgid "All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by ``sys.stdin.fileno()``, or a :term:`file object`, such as ``sys.stdin`` itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:22
msgid "This module also defines all the constants needed to work with the functions provided here; these have the same name as their counterparts in C.  Please refer to your system documentation for more information on using these terminal control interfaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:27
msgid "The module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:32
msgid "Return a list containing the tty attributes for file descriptor *fd*, as follows: ``[iflag, oflag, cflag, lflag, ispeed, ospeed, cc]`` where *cc* is a list of the tty special characters (each a string of length 1, except the items with indices :const:`VMIN` and :const:`VTIME`, which are integers when these fields are defined).  The interpretation of the flags and the speeds as well as the indexing in the *cc* array must be done using the symbolic constants defined in the :mod:`termios` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:43
msgid "Set the tty attributes for file descriptor *fd* from the *attributes*, which is a list like the one returned by :func:`tcgetattr`.  The *when* argument determines when the attributes are changed: :const:`TCSANOW` to change immediately, :const:`TCSADRAIN` to change after transmitting all queued output, or :const:`TCSAFLUSH` to change after transmitting all queued output and discarding all queued input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:53
msgid "Send a break on file descriptor *fd*.  A zero *duration* sends a break for 0.25 --0.5 seconds; a nonzero *duration* has a system dependent meaning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:59
msgid "Wait until all output written to file descriptor *fd* has been transmitted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:64
msgid "Discard queued data on file descriptor *fd*.  The *queue* selector specifies which queue: :const:`TCIFLUSH` for the input queue, :const:`TCOFLUSH` for the output queue, or :const:`TCIOFLUSH` for both queues."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/termios.rst:71
msgid "Suspend or resume input or output on file descriptor *fd*.  The *action* argument can be :const:`TCOOFF` to suspend output, :const:`TCOON` to restart output, :const:`TCIOFF` to suspend input, or :const:`TCION` to restart input."

msgid "Here's a function that prompts for a password with echoing turned off.  Note the technique using a separate :func:`tcgetattr` call and a :keyword:`try` ... :keyword:`finally` statement to ensure that the old tty attributes are restored exactly no matter what happens::"
