msgid "It defines a :class:`BaseSelector` abstract base class, along with several concrete implementations (:class:`KqueueSelector`, :class:`EpollSelector`...), that can be used to wait for I/O readiness notification on multiple file objects. In the following, \"file object\" refers to any object with a :meth:`fileno()` method, or a raw file descriptor. See :term:`file object`."

It supports file stream registration, unregistration, and a method to wait for I/O events on those streams, with an optional timeout. It's an abstract base class, so cannot be instantiated. Use :class:`DefaultSelector` instead, or one of :class:`SelectSelector`, :class:`KqueueSelector` etc. if you want to specifically use an implementation, and your platform supports it. :class:`BaseSelector` and its concrete implementations support the :term:`context manager` protocol."
