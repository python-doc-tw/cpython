msgid "This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data. It provides encoding and decoding functions for the encodings specified in :rfc:`3548`, which defines the Base16, Base32, and Base64 algorithms, and for the de-facto standard Ascii85 and Base85 encodings."

msgid "The :rfc:`3548` encodings are suitable for encoding binary data so that it can safely sent by email, used as parts of URLs, or included as part of an HTTP POST request.  The encoding algorithm is not the same as the :program:`uuencode` program."

msgid "There are two :rfc:`3548` interfaces provided by this module.  The modern interface supports encoding and decoding ASCII byte string objects using all three :rfc:`3548` defined alphabets (normal, URL-safe, and filesystem-safe). Additionally, the decoding functions of the modern interface also accept Unicode strings containing only ASCII characters. The legacy interface provides for encoding and decoding to and from file-like objects as well as byte strings, but only using the Base64 standard alphabet."
