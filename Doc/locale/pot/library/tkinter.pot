msgid "The :mod:`tkinter` package (\"Tk interface\") is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.  Both Tk and :mod:`tkinter` are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems.  (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.) You can check that :mod:`tkinter` is properly installed on your system by running ``python -m tkinter`` from the command line; this should open a window demonstrating a simple Tk interface."

msgid "In Tk, there is a utility command, ``wm``, for interacting with the window manager.  Options to the ``wm`` command allow you to control things like titles, placement, icon bitmaps, and the like.  In :mod:`tkinter`, these commands have been implemented as methods on the :class:`Wm` class.  Toplevel widgets are subclassed from the :class:`Wm` class, and so can call the :class:`Wm` methods directly."

Of course if the widget has been packed inside of a frame, the master won't represent a toplevel window.  To get at the toplevel window that contains an arbitrary widget, you can call the :meth:`_root` method. This method begins with an underscore to denote the fact that this function is part of the implementation, and not an interface to Tk functionality."
