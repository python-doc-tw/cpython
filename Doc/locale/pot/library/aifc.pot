msgid "This module provides support for reading and writing AIFF and AIFF-C files. AIFF is Audio Interchange File Format, a format for storing digital audio samples in a file.  AIFF-C is a newer version of the format that includes the ability to compress the audio data."

msgid "Audio files have a number of parameters that describe the audio data. The sampling rate or frame rate is the number of times per second the sound is sampled.  The number of channels indicate if the audio is mono, stereo, or quadro.  Each frame consists of one sample per channel.  The sample size is the size in bytes of each sample.  Thus a frame consists of ``nchannels * samplesize`` bytes, and a second's worth of audio consists of ``nchannels * samplesize * framerate`` bytes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/aifc.rst:36
msgid "For example, CD quality audio has a sample size of two bytes (16 bits), uses two channels (stereo) and has a frame rate of 44,100 frames/second.  This gives a frame size of 4 bytes (2\\*2), and a second's worth occupies 2\\*2\\*44100 bytes (176,400 bytes)."

The argument *file* is either a string naming a file or a :term:`file object`.  *mode* must be ``'r'`` or ``'rb'`` when the file must be opened for reading, or ``'w'``  or ``'wb'`` when the file must be opened for writing. If omitted, ``file.mode`` is used if it exists, otherwise ``'rb'`` is used.  When used for writing, the file object should be seekable, unless you know ahead of time how many samples you are going to write in total and use :meth:`writeframesraw` and :meth:`setnframes`. The :func:`.open` function may be used in a :keyword:`with` statement.  When the :keyword:`with` block completes, the :meth:`~aifc.close` method is called."
