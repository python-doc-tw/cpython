msgid "The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable data-type as cookie value."

msgid "The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the :rfc:`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered that MSIE 3.0x doesn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs and also many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules when comes to Cookie handling.  As a result, the parsing rules used are a bit less strict."
