msgid ":mod:`ensurepip` --- Bootstrapping the ``pip`` installer"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:10
msgid "The :mod:`ensurepip` package provides support for bootstrapping the ``pip`` installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment. This bootstrapping approach reflects the fact that ``pip`` is an independent project with its own release cycle, and the latest available stable version is bundled with maintenance and feature releases of the CPython reference interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/ensurepip.rst:17
msgid "In most cases, end users of Python shouldn't need to invoke this module directly (as ``pip`` should be bootstrapped by default), but it may be needed if installing ``pip`` was skipped when installing Python (or when creating a virtual environment) or after explicitly uninstalling ``pip``."

msgid "By default, ``pip`` is installed into the current virtual environment (if one is active) or into the system site packages (if there is no active virtual environment). The installation location can be controlled through two additional command line options:"
