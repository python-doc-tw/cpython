Qt is an extensive C++ GUI application development framework that is available for Unix, Windows and Mac OS X. :program:`sip` is a tool for generating bindings for C++ libraries as Python classes, and is specifically designed for Python. The *PyQt3* bindings have a book, `GUI Programming with Python: QT Edition <http://www.commandprompt.com/community/pyqt/>`_ by Boudewijn Rempt. The *PyQt4* bindings also have a book, `Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt <http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html>`_, by Mark Summerfield."

It provides a native look and feel for applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix systems by using each platform's native widgets where ever possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like systems).  In addition to an extensive set of widgets, wxPython provides classes for online documentation and context sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing, low-level device context drawing, drag and drop, system clipboard access, an XML-based resource format and more, including an ever growing library of user-contributed modules.  wxPython has a book, `wxPython in Action <http://www.manning.com/rappin/>`_, by Noel Rappin and Robin Dunn."

msgid "PyGTK, PyQt, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more widgets than Tkinter. In addition, there are many other GUI toolkits for Python, both cross-platform, and platform-specific. See the `GUI Programming <https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming>`_ page in the Python Wiki for a much more complete list, and also for links to documents where the different GUI toolkits are compared."
